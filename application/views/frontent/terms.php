        <p><strong>Analytics and Third-Party Tools</strong></p> 
        <p>During your visit to our website, your browsing behavior may be analyzed statistically. This is usually done through cookies and analytics.

        Revoking Consent for Data Processing Many data processing operations require your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email is sufficient for this request. Data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</P>
        <p><b>Data Portability</b></p> 
        <p>You have the right to receive your personal data that we process based on your consent or as part of a contract, in a standard, machine-readable format. You may choose to have the data delivered to yourself or to a third party. If you request the direct transfer of data to another party, this will only be possible if it is technically feasible.</p>
        <p><b>Encryption</b></p> 
        <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption to ensure the security and protection of your confidential information, such as inquiries you send to us as the site operator. When you access a secure connection, you will notice a change from "http://" to "https://" in your browser's address bar and a lock icon will appear in the address bar. This encryption ensures that any data you send to us cannot be intercepted by unauthorized third parties.</p>
        <p><b>Data Access, Correction, and Deletion</b></p> 
        <p>You have the right to access and receive information about any of your personal data stored with us at any time, free of charge.

        <h2> 3. Opt-Out of Promotional Emails </h2> 
        <p>We strictly prohibit the use of contact data published on this website for sending unsolicited promotional or informational materials. We reserve the right to take legal action against any form of unsolicited advertising, such as spam emails.</p>
        <h2> 4. Our website collects data through various means to improve its user experience and ensure security. </h2>
        <p><b>Cookies:</b> We use cookies, small text files stored on your device by your browser, to make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Most of the cookies we use are session cookies and are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain on your device until you delete them. You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies and decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject them. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.</p>
        <p><b>Server Log Files:</b> Our website provider automatically collects and stores information transmitted from your browser to our website in server log files. This information includes browser type and version, operating system used, referrer URL, host name of the accessing computer, time of the server request, and IP address. This data will not be combined with other sources.</p> 
        <p><b>Registration:</b> You can register on our website to access additional functions. The data you provide during registration will be used only for the purpose of using the respective site or service for which you have registered. If mandatory information is not provided, we will reject the registration.</p> 
        <p><b>Leaving Comments:</b> If you use the comment function on our website, your comment, time of creation, email address, and username (unless posting anonymously) will be stored. Our comment function also stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. We need this information to pursue action for illegal or slanderous content.</p>
        <p><b>Comment Storage:</b> Comments and associated data (e.g. IP address) will be stored on our website until the content commented upon is deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).</p> 
        <h2> 5. Sharing Content through Social Media Plugins (Reddit, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.) </h2> 
        <p>Our website pages include the option to share content on various social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. This feature is enabled by a custom tool that is created in-house and integrates share buttons. The connection between the social networks and the users is only established when the user clicks on one of these buttons.</p>
        <p>This tool does not automatically transfer any user data to the social network providers. In case the user is logged into one or more of these networks, the Like and Share buttons will display a pop-up window, allowing the user to edit the text before sharing.
        Our users can share the content of our website without the social network providers collecting data about their browsing behavior.</p>
        <h2> 6. Analytics and Advertising Google AdSense </h2>
